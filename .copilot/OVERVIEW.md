# Smart Chunks, Better Search: Enhancing Vector Indexing with Typesense and AI Tools

## Overview 

### Captivating Introduction

Getting good answers from a chatbot or semantic search system isn’t just about the model—it’s about how well your data is prepared. Chunking plays a huge role in how effective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) really is. In this session, we’ll shift the spotlight from flashy use cases to the behind-the-scenes work that makes them possible: breaking down documents the *right* way and feeding them into your vector index.

We'll explore what chunking strategies exist today, how they impact retrieval quality, and which tools can help you get it right—from lightweight syntax-aware chunkers to AI-powered semantic parsers—and how you can integrate these into your stack using Typesense.

### Prerequisite

Familiarity with basic understanding of vector search and an interest in AI-enhanced workflows. No deep AI or data science knowledge required—just a desire to go beyond the basics.

### Outline

In this session, we’ll explore why **chunking is a critical piece of the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline** and how the way we break down content can make or break the quality of AI responses.

We'll look at a range of **chunking strategies**, including fixed-size blocks, sliding windows, semantic chunking based on meaning, and hybrid approaches that combine the best of each.

To make chunking easier and more effective, we’ll introduce some powerful **tools designed for the job**. You’ll get to know **Marker**, which offers an intuitive interface for prepping documents for RAG, and **MarkItDown**, a markdown-aware splitter from Microsoft. We'll also look at **Unstructured.io**, a flexible API that handles content from all kinds of file formats, and **LlamaParse** from LlamaIndex, known for its high-quality parsing tailored for LLM use.

We'll also talk about the **trade-offs between quality and performance**, share some benchmarks, and highlight key lessons learned along the way.

To close things out, we’ll take a look at **what’s next**—from emerging best practices to the roadmap for development and how the community is helping shape the future of AI-powered search.

### Learning Objectives

- Learn how chunking affects the quality of responses in vector search and RAG systems
- Discover modern tools and libraries that improve document segmentation and preprocessing
- Understand how to incorporate advanced chunking workflows into a Typesense stack
- Evaluate trade-offs and choose the best approach based on your project needs
