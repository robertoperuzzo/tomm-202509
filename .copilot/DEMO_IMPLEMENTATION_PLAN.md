# Demo Implementation Plan

## Objective
The goal of this demo is to showcase the effectiveness of advanced chunking strategies and tools in improving vector indexing and retrieval quality in AI-powered search systems. The demo will highlight the practical application of the concepts described in the `OVERVIEW.md` file.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Preparation
- **Dataset**: Use a publicly available dataset with diverse document types (e.g., text, markdown, PDFs).
- **Preprocessing**: Implement preprocessing steps such as cleaning, normalization, and metadata extraction.
- **Chunking**: Demonstrate various chunking strategies:
  - Fixed-size blocks
  - Sliding windows
  - Semantic chunking using AI tools
  - Hybrid approaches

### 2. Tools and Libraries
- **Marker**: For intuitive document preparation.
- **MarkItDown**: For markdown-aware splitting.
- **Unstructured.io**: For handling diverse file formats.
- **LlamaParse**: For high-quality semantic parsing.
- **Typesense**: For vector indexing and search.

### 3. Workflow
- **Pipeline**:
  1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
  2. Apply chunking strategies.
  3. Index the chunks into Typesense.
  4. Perform retrieval queries to evaluate quality.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Compare retrieval quality across chunking strategies.
  - Measure trade-offs between quality and performance.

### 4. User Interface
- **Frontend**:
  - Build a simple web interface to visualize the demo.
  - Use the [Typesense InstantSearch Adapter](https://github.com/typesense/typesense-instantsearch-adapter) to create a conversational chatbot interface.
  - Customize the chatbot UI to allow users to input queries and display results in a chat-like format.
- **Backend**:
  - Use a Python-based framework (e.g., Flask or FastAPI) to handle API requests.
  - Integrate with Typesense for search and retrieval using the InstantSearch Adapter.

### Advantages of Using Typesense InstantSearch Adapter
- Simplifies the development process with pre-built components for search and filtering.
- Provides flexibility to customize the chatbot's behavior and appearance.
- Ensures high performance and responsiveness for the demo.

### 5. Deployment
- **Local Setup**:
  - Provide instructions for running the demo locally.
- **Cloud Deployment**:
  - Deploy the demo on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, or Heroku) for broader accessibility.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python (for backend and preprocessing).
- **Frontend Framework**: React or plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript for simplicity.
- **Search Engine**: Typesense.
- **AI Tools**: Marker, MarkItDown, Unstructured.io, LlamaParse.
- **Deployment**: Docker for containerization, cloud platform for hosting.

## Next Steps
1. Finalize the dataset to be used.
2. Define evaluation metrics for retrieval quality.
3. Set up a development environment with the required tools and libraries.
4. Prototype the pipeline and test individual components.
5. Develop the user interface and integrate it with the backend.
6. Test the complete demo and refine based on feedback.

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Data preparation and preprocessing.
- **Week 2**: Implement chunking strategies and indexing.
- **Week 3**: Develop the user interface and backend.
- **Week 4**: Test, deploy, and document the demo.

## Notes
- Focus on simplicity and clarity to make the demo accessible to a broad audience.
- Highlight the impact of chunking strategies on retrieval quality through visualizations and benchmarks.
