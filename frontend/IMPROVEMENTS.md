# Frontend Improvements Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Document-Level Grouping**

- Modified the frontend to group search results by `document_id` instead of showing individual chunks
- Each document now shows as a single result with aggregated information

### 2. **Enhanced Document Display**

- **Document Title**: Prominently displayed with search highlighting
- **Document ID**: Shows the unique identifier for the document
- **Chunk Statistics**:
  - Number of chunks found that match the search query
  - Total number of chunks in the document
  - Token range (min-max tokens per chunk)

### 3. **Content Preview**

- Shows the most relevant chunk content as a preview
- Maintains search term highlighting
- Cleaner, more focused presentation

### 4. **Improved Relevance Scoring**

- Documents are ranked by average relevance score of all matching chunks
- Only the top 3 most relevant chunks per document are considered for ranking
- Better semantic grouping of related content

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:

- Users saw many individual chunks from the same document
- Difficult to understand which documents were most relevant
- Redundant information across similar chunks
- Cluttered interface with too much detail

### After:

- Clean document-level overview
- Clear understanding of document relevance
- Quick access to key statistics (chunk count, token ranges)
- Preview of most relevant content
- Better comparison across chunking strategies

## Technical Implementation

### Key Functions:

1. **`groupHitsByDocument(hits)`**: Groups search results by document_id
2. **`renderDocumentHit(document, strategyName)`**: Renders document-level results
3. **Enhanced CSS**: New styles for document headers, statistics, and previews

### Data Structure:

```javascript
{
  document_id: "9308101_Dynamic Backtracking",
  document_title: "Dynamic Backtracking",
  chunks: [...], // Top 3 most relevant chunks
  relevanceScore: 0.85, // Average relevance
  allChunkCount: 27, // Total chunks in document
  tokenRange: { min: 445, max: 512 } // Token count range
}
```

## Search Flow

1. User enters search query
2. System searches across all chunking strategy collections
3. Results are grouped by document_id
4. Documents ranked by average chunk relevance
5. Display shows document info + most relevant content preview
6. Statistics provide insight into chunking strategy effectiveness

This approach gives you a much cleaner view of which documents are semantically relevant to your query, while still providing insights into how different chunking strategies perform.
