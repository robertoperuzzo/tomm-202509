# ADR-001: ArXiv Paper Download Implementation

## Date

2025-08-27

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The chunking strategies demo system required the ability to download ArXiv papers for preprocessing and evaluation. The user specifically requested "ArXiv download capability and add the python script in `src/download` folder" to complete the preprocessing pipeline implementation from the Demo Implementation Plan.

The system needed:

- Comprehensive ArXiv API integration for paper search and download
- Async/concurrent download capabilities for performance
- Rich progress tracking and user experience
- Professional metadata extraction and management
- Integration with the existing preprocessing pipeline
- Separation of download concerns from processing logic

## Decision

We implemented a comprehensive ArXiv downloading system with the following components:

### Core Implementation:

1. **ArxivDownloader Class** (`src/download/arxiv_downloader.py`)

   - Full-featured ArXiv API integration with XML parsing
   - Async/await pattern for concurrent downloads (5 concurrent max)
   - Rich progress tracking and console output using Rich library
   - Comprehensive error handling and retry logic with fallback mechanisms
   - Smart PDF download with metadata extraction

2. **ArxivPaper Dataclass**

   - Structured representation of ArXiv papers with automatic validation
   - Text cleaning and normalization of titles, abstracts, author names
   - JSON serialization support for data persistence
   - Rich metadata including authors, categories, abstracts, publication dates

3. **Convenience Functions**

   - `download_papers_by_query()`: Search-based downloads with custom queries
   - `download_papers_by_category()`: Category-based downloads (e.g., cs.AI)
   - Both implemented with async patterns and progress tracking

4. **Demo Script** (`scripts/download_demo.py`)
   - Command-line interface with argparse for flexible usage
   - Rich console output with professional formatting and tables
   - Integration guidance for preprocessing pipeline
   - Configurable paper counts and search queries

### Technical Features:

- **ArXiv API Integration**: Full query support with search parameters, XML response parsing with proper namespace handling, metadata extraction, PDF URL resolution
- **Async Download Management**: Concurrent downloads with semaphore limiting, aiohttp client session management, async file I/O with aiofiles
- **Progress Tracking & UX**: Rich console library integration, real-time progress bars, professional table display, color-coded status messages
- **File Management**: Automatic directory creation, safe filename generation, duplicate detection and skipping, cleanup of partial downloads on failure

### Dependencies Added:

- `aiohttp`: Async HTTP client for ArXiv API calls
- `aiofiles`: Async file I/O operations
- `rich`: Beautiful console output and progress tracking

## Consequences

### What becomes easier:

- **ArXiv Paper Access**: Researchers can easily download papers by category or search query
- **Batch Operations**: Concurrent downloads significantly improve performance for multiple papers
- **User Experience**: Rich progress tracking and professional output make the tool user-friendly
- **Pipeline Integration**: Downloaded papers flow seamlessly into the preprocessing pipeline
- **Metadata Management**: Structured ArXiv paper representation with automatic cleaning
- **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling ensures partial failures don't stop the entire process

### What becomes more difficult:

- **Dependency Management**: Added three new dependencies that need to be maintained
- **Complexity**: Async programming patterns require more sophisticated error handling
- **Rate Limiting**: Need to be mindful of ArXiv API rate limits and implement proper throttling
- **Storage Management**: Downloaded PDFs consume disk space and need cleanup strategies

### Long-term Benefits:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Download logic is separate from processing, enabling modular architecture
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add other paper sources (PubMed, Google Scholar) using similar patterns
- **Research Enablement**: Provides foundation for large-scale academic paper analysis
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling and progress tracking suitable for production use

The implementation successfully completes the ArXiv integration requirements and provides a solid foundation for the complete chunking strategies comparison system outlined in the Demo Implementation Plan.
