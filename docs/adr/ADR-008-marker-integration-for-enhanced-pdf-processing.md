# ADR-008: Integration of Marker Library for Enhanced PDF Processing and Document Structure Extraction

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The current document preprocessing implementation in `src/preprocessor/document_preprocessor.py` utilizes two PDF extraction methods as per ADR-007:

### Current Implementation

1. **LangChain PyPDFParser** - Fast extraction using LangChain's PyPDFParser wrapper around pypdf
2. **Unstructured.io** - Premium quality with structure awareness for element-based processing

### Emerging Needs and Limitations

While the current implementation covers basic text extraction and structure-aware processing, we have identified several areas for improvement based on the demo requirements outlined in `DEMO_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`:

#### Current Gaps

1. **Limited Markdown Output**: Current methods output plain text or JSON, but the demo specifically targets markdown conversion for improved downstream processing and chunking
2. **Complex Layout Handling**: Scientific papers (ArXiv dataset) contain complex layouts with mathematical equations, figures, tables, and multi-column layouts that current methods struggle with
3. **Mathematical Content**: LaTeX equation handling is limited, crucial for technical document processing
4. **Image and Figure Extraction**: While Unstructured handles some image extraction, it's not optimized for academic papers with complex figures and diagrams
5. **Chunking Strategy Integration**: Need for output formats specifically designed for RAG applications (chunks format)
6. **Performance at Scale**: Processing large volumes of ArXiv papers requires efficient batch processing capabilities

### Why Marker Library?

Marker (https://github.com/datalab-to/marker) is a state-of-the-art document conversion tool that addresses these specific gaps:

#### Key Advantages

1. **Native Markdown Output**: Built specifically to convert documents to clean markdown format, ideal for our chunking strategies demo
2. **Superior Complex Layout Handling**: Uses deep learning models for layout detection and reading order determination, specifically optimized for academic papers
3. **Advanced Mathematical Processing**: Converts inline math and equations to proper LaTeX format within markdown
4. **High-Quality Image Extraction**: Extracts and saves images while maintaining references in the converted text
5. **Multiple Output Formats**: Supports markdown, JSON, HTML, and a specialized "chunks" format designed for RAG applications
6. **LLM Enhancement**: Optional LLM integration for improved accuracy and table formatting
7. **Proven Performance**: Benchmarks favorably against cloud services (LlamaParse, Mathpix) and other open-source tools
8. **Batch Processing**: Built-in support for multi-GPU processing and high-throughput document conversion

#### Performance Characteristics

Based on Marker's benchmarks:

- **Speed**: Processes ~25 pages/second on H100 GPU in batch mode
- **Accuracy**: Consistently outperforms competitors across different document types
- **Memory Efficiency**: Uses ~5GB VRAM per worker at peak, 3.5GB average
- **Document Type Support**: Excellent performance on scientific papers (96.67% accuracy)

#### Technical Capabilities

1. **Document Structure Detection**: Identifies titles, headings, paragraphs, tables, lists, and maintains hierarchy
2. **OCR Integration**: Built-in OCR with Surya for scanned documents
3. **Table Extraction**: Advanced table detection and HTML/markdown conversion
4. **Multi-language Support**: Processes documents in all languages
5. **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design with providers, builders, processors, and renderers

## Decision

We will integrate the Marker library as a **third PDF extraction method** alongside existing LangChain and Unstructured.io approaches, positioning it as the **"Premium Plus/Research-Grade"** extraction method.

### Implementation Strategy

#### Method 3: Marker (Premium Plus/Research-Grade)

- **Library**: `marker-pdf` (to be added to requirements.txt)
- **Positioning**: Highest quality extraction specifically optimized for academic and research documents
- **Use Case**: When maximum text quality, structure preservation, and markdown output are critical
- **Target Documents**: ArXiv papers, academic publications, technical documents with complex layouts

#### Integration Architecture

```python
class MarkerExtractor:
    """Marker-based PDF extraction with performance tracking."""

    def __init__(self, config: Optional[Dict] = None):
        """Initialize Marker converter with optional configuration."""

    def extract_text(self, pdf_path: Path) -> ExtractionResult:
        """Extract text using Marker with full performance metrics."""

    def extract_with_structure(self, pdf_path: Path) -> StructuredExtractionResult:
        """Extract with document structure preservation."""

    def batch_extract(self, pdf_paths: List[Path]) -> List[ExtractionResult]:
        """Batch processing for multiple documents."""
```

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Core Integration

#### Dependencies

```python
# Add to requirements.txt
marker-pdf>=1.8.0
torch>=2.0.0  # Required by Marker
```

#### Configuration Options

```python
MARKER_CONFIG = {
    "output_format": "markdown",  # Default for demo
    "use_llm": False,             # Optional LLM enhancement
    "force_ocr": False,          # OCR control
    "extract_images": True,       # Image extraction
    "paginate_output": False,     # Page separation
    "debug": False               # Debug mode
}
```

### 2. Performance Tracking

Each Marker extraction must track comprehensive metrics:

```python
{
    "processing_time_seconds": float,
    "memory_usage_mb": float,
    "characters_extracted": int,
    "pages_processed": int,
    "extraction_rate": float,           # chars/second
    "images_extracted": int,
    "tables_detected": int,
    "equations_processed": int,
    "structure_elements": {             # Document structure metrics
        "headings": int,
        "paragraphs": int,
        "lists": int,
        "code_blocks": int
    },
    "output_format": str,              # markdown/json/html/chunks
    "marker_version": str,
    "llm_enhanced": bool
}
```

### 3. Output Format Standardization

#### Markdown Output (Default)

- Clean markdown with preserved formatting
- LaTeX equations in proper fencing (`$$..$$`)
- Table formatting in markdown syntax
- Image links with extracted files saved separately

#### Chunks Format (RAG-Optimized)

- Flat list structure optimized for vector indexing
- Each chunk with metadata (page_id, section_hierarchy, block_type)
- Pre-segmented content suitable for embedding

#### JSON Output (Structure Analysis)

- Full document tree with block hierarchy
- Bounding boxes and positioning information
- Element type classification
- Metadata extraction

### 4. Quality Assessment Metrics

#### Content Quality

```python
{
    "text_coherence_score": float,      # Sentence boundary quality
    "structure_preservation": float,     # Hierarchy maintenance
    "equation_accuracy": float,         # LaTeX conversion quality
    "table_structure_score": float,     # Table formatting quality
    "image_reference_integrity": float, # Image link consistency
    "chunk_boundary_quality": float     # For chunks format
}
```

#### Comparison Benchmarks

- Side-by-side quality comparison with existing methods
- Processing speed comparison
- Memory usage comparison
- Output format preference analysis

### 5. Error Handling and Fallback

```python
class MarkerExtractionError(Exception):
    """Custom exception for Marker extraction failures."""

def extract_with_fallback(pdf_path: Path) -> ExtractionResult:
    """
    Attempt Marker extraction with graceful fallback to Unstructured.io
    if GPU resources are unavailable or processing fails.
    """
```

### 6. Batch Processing Integration

```python
def batch_process_arxiv_papers(
    paper_paths: List[Path],
    output_dir: Path,
    workers: Optional[int] = None,
    use_gpu: bool = True
) -> BatchProcessingResult:
    """
    Batch process ArXiv papers using Marker's multi-worker capabilities.
    """
```
