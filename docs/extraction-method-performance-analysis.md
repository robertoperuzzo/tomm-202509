## Conclusion

The performance differences between extraction methods reflect their design priorities:

- **PyPDF** and **MarkItDown** prioritize speed over advanced features
- **Unstructured** balances speed and quality for general use cases
- **Marker** prioritizes maximum quality and accuracy for academic content

The 47-minute processing time for Marker represents the cost of research-grade document understanding, with multiple AI models working together to preserve every aspect of complex academic documents. While slower, this investment in processing time delivers significantly higher quality outputs, especially for mathematical and scientific content.

For optimal system performance, the choice of extraction method should be based on document complexity and quality requirements rather than processing speed alone.
