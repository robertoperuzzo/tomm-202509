# Archived Implementation Documentation

This directory contains the original implementation documentation files that have been converted to proper Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in `/docs/adr/`.

## Archived Files

- `ARXIV_DOWNLOAD_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` → Now `ADR-001-arxiv-download-implementation.md`
- `PREPROCESSING_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` → Now `ADR-002-preprocessing-pipeline-implementation.md`
- `PREPROCESSING_REFACTORING_COMPLETE.md` → Now `ADR-003-preprocessing-architecture-refactoring.md`
- `TESTING_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` → Now `ADR-004-unit-testing-implementation.md`

## Why Archived?

These files were the original implementation documentation written during development. They have been converted to proper ADR format following the standard template:

- Date
- Status
- Context
- Decision
- Consequences

The ADR format provides better structure for architectural decisions and is more suitable for long-term documentation and decision tracking.

## Access

For current documentation, see `/docs/adr/README.md` and the individual ADR files.
